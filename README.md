# MicroDocs

# Welcome

## Overview
Micro Docs is a simple system for creating web-accessible documentation using Markdown.

## Demo
Micro Docs can be seen in action in a [public demo](https://soft.rendeer.pl/MicroDocs/docs/).

## Requirements
Micro Docs requires a web server with PHP.

## Functionalities
### Structure
* Micro Docs enables a hierarchical structure of pages managed from a centralized index.
* The structure is displayed in the left side of the page.
* The first document in the structure automatically becomes the landing page for the whole documentation.
* The structure contains links to subpages.
* _(planned)_ When a particular page is open, the structure displays its headers as sub-entries.

### Document
* Documents can contain text content formatted with [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
* _(planned)_ Documents can link to each other.
* _(planned)_ Documents can contain locally stored images.
